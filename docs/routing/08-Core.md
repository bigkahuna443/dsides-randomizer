| a-00 | - | - | - | - | - | - | Cut (heart gate room) |
| a-01 | N/A | Expert | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1DF requires neutral or grab jump off lava wall |
| a-02 | N/A | Perfect | Hard | N/A | N/A | Expert | 2DR requires one setupless lava wall neutral, 1DF requires several |
| a-03 | N/A | Expert | Hard | N/A | N/A | Expert | 1DF has a tricky refill grab, cornerkick makes a little easier; 2DR requires precise core block jumps |
| a-04 | N/A | N/A | Expert | N/A | N/A | Hard | There-and-back room; 2DF requires lava wallbounce |
| a-05 | N/A | Expert | Normal | N/A | N/A | N/A | Currently dead-end room; 1DF requires lava wallbounce |
| a-06 | N/A | Perfect | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1DF possible last bumper move incredibly precise (done RTA once), possible reverse but cut due to changes needed |
| b-01 | N/A | Expert | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1DF requires tricky routing (switch avoidance), climb buffer or precise fall + neutral at the end |
| b-02 | N/A | N/A | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A |  |
| b-03 | N/A | Perfect | Expert | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1DF possible but ultra precise (done RTA once) |
| b-04 | N/A | N/A | Hard | N/A | N/A | Perfect | 2DR requires core block spike respawn tech or very very precise dashes |
| b-05 | N/A | Perfect | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1DF requires weird off-ledge reverse super at beginning, really annoying |
| b-06 | N/A | N/A | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A |  |
| c-01 | N/A | Perfect | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1DF possible, very precise lava neutral/late wallbounce required |
| c-02 | N/A | Hard | Normal | N/A | N/A | N/A |  |
| c-03 | N/A | N/A | Normal | N/A | N/A | N/A |  |
| c-04 | N/A | N/A | Normal | N/A | N/A | N/A |  |
| c-05 | N/A | Perfect | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1DF possible, requires ice wall neutral at beginning and near-pixel perfect Kevin interaction at end |
| d-01 | N/A | Hard | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A |  |
| d-02 | N/A | Perfect | Hard | N/A | N/A | Perfect | 1DF requires ice wall neutrals (2-5 depending on core launch), 2DR possible, requires a ton of waiting + very precise |
| d-03 | N/A | Expert | Hard | N/A | N/A | Perfect | 2DR has tricky core jumps/lava cycles... consistent strat is to hit first switch w/o touching bottom core block, then launch up to the top core blocks, launch left, grab jump over the next two then dash over the last one and launch left to the second switch, then as the core block breaks jump and dash to the next block and grab jump over, neutral to the end |
| d-04 | N/A | Expert | Hard | N/A | N/A | Perfect | Dash refill lets you skip second switch (makes second half easy), 2DR have to do really tight dash (near pixel perfect) through ice ball corridor... |
| d-05 | N/A | N/A | Master | N/A | N/A | N/A | Reverse technically possible but bad spawn (thanks Etpio) |
| d-06 | N/A | Expert | Expert | N/A | N/A | N/A | Requires lava wallbounces/neutrals with setups  |
