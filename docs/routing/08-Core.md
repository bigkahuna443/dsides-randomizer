| a-00 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Cut (heart gate room) |
| a-01 | N/A | Expert | Normal | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1DF requires neutral or grab jump off lava wall |
| a-02 | N/A | Perfect | Hard | N/A | N/A | Expert | 2DR requires setupless lava wall neutrals, 1DF requires several |
| a-03 | N/A | Hard | Hard | N/A | N/A | Perfect | 1DF has a tricky refill grab, cornerkick makes a little easier; 2DR requires very precise core block jumps |
| a-04 | N/A | N/A | Expert | N/A | N/A | Hard | This is normally there-and-back room, so technically one exit is expert + hard (respawn added to make it work) |
| a-05 | N/A | Hard | Normal | N/A | N/A | N/A | Currently dead-end room, good spot for future collectable |
| a-06 | N/A | N/A | Normal | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1DF possible but one bumper move too precise, possible reverse but cut due to changes needed |
| b-01 | N/A | Expert | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1DF requires tricky routing (switch avoidance), climb buffer or precise fall + neutral at the end |
| b-02 | N/A | N/A | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A |  |
| b-03 | N/A | N/A | Expert | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1DF possible but ultra precise, cut |
| b-04 | N/A | N/A | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A | 2DR possible but requires core block spike respawn tech or way too precise dashes, so cut |
| b-05 | N/A | N/A | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1DF requires weird off-ledge reverse super at beginning, really annoying, cut |
| b-06 | N/A | N/A | Normal | N/A | N/A | N/A |  |
| c-01 | N/A | N/A | Normal | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1DF possible, way too precise lava neutrals required so cut |
| c-02 | N/A | Hard | Normal | N/A | N/A | N/A |  |
| c-03 | N/A | N/A | Normal | N/A | N/A | N/A |  |
| c-04 | N/A | N/A | Normal | N/A | N/A | N/A |  |
| c-05 | N/A | N/A | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1DF possible but cut, requires ice wall neutral at beginning and near-pixel perfect Kevin interaction at end |
| d-01 | N/A | Hard | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A |  |
| d-02 | N/A | Perfect | Hard | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1DF requires ice wall neutrals (2-5 depending on core launch), 2DR possible, requires a ton of waiting + very precise so cut |
| d-03 | N/A | Hard | Hard | N/A | N/A | Perfect | 2DR has tricky core jumps/lava cycles... consistent strat is to hit first switch w/o touching bottom core block, then launch up to the top core blocks, launch left, grab jump over the next two then dash over the last one and launch left to the second switch, then as the core block breaks jump and dash to the next block and grab jump over, neutral to the end |
| d-04 | N/A | Hard | Hard | N/A | N/A | Hard | Dash refill lets you skip second switch (makes second half easy), 2DR starts in cold mode (in vanilla can enter with either flag) |
| d-05 | N/A | N/A | Perfect | N/A | N/A | N/A | No special strats, room is just awful |
| d-06 | N/A | Normal | Normal | N/A | N/A | N/A |  |
