Celeste D-sides Randomizer
==========================

This is a collection of randomizer configuration files and routing descriptions for the [D-sides pack](https://gamebanana.com/maps/202524) of maps for [Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/). 

The config is designed to be compatible with the [Celeste randomizer mod](https://github.com/rhelmot/CelesteRandomizer) developed by rhelmot.


Installation
------------

**Automatic**:
1. Download the [D-sides pack](https://gamebanana.com/maps/202524).
2. The config is included by default and the D-sides will be available in the randomizer level select screen.

**Manual**:
1. Unzip the D-sides folder in your Celeste/Mods directory.
2. Place the Config folder from this repository into the D-sides folder.

3. The D-sides will now be available in the randomizer level select screen.


Difficulty Modes
----------------

The difficulty modes are intended as follows:

- *Normal:* Easier D-side rooms, requires only common speedrun tech (neutrals, super/hyper/wavedashes, reverses)
- *Hard:* Average D-side difficulty, may require tech taught in the D-sides (bubble hypers, cassette jumps, etc.)
- *Expert:* Harder D-side rooms, may require some setupless moves (corner jumps, easy demodashes, etc.)
- *Perfect:* Hardest D-side rooms, may require multiple setupless moves and/or obscure tech (e.g. updiag demos)

These are loosely based off the original randomizer difficulty recommendations but are *not* equivalent. A good rule of thumb is that Normal and Hard are a level higher than their vanilla counterparts, and they start evening out in Expert. Perfect is probably easier than in the main game due to removing pixel-perfect demos and other frustrating moves.

If you find new routes or would like to suggest tweaks or changes to difficulty ratings, feel free to contact me! You can see the current difficulty ratings in the [documentation](docs/routing).


Known Issues / Planned Additions
--------------------------------
1. There are not a huge number of dashless screens, which means you may have to supplement from the base game/other mods to generate larger/interesting dashless maps.
2. Camera work needs to be done for most reverse paths -- the routes with the worst camera were focused on for now. If you run across a route with a bad camera that significantly affects gameplay, let me know.
3. Currently all non-exits/entrances are disabled for now, which means the "Strange Holes" setting doesn't really have an effect. I'll gradually add some strange holes in on a case-by-case basis, since turning them all on at once tends to break things.
4. Will make the config compatible with new randomizer features as they are created.
